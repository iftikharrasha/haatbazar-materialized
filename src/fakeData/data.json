First of all thankyou so much for giving us a platform to introduce our small businesses to our fellow seniors, batchmates and juniors. My business is basically based on authentic Pakistani women wear ( Dress & saree) I started my venture just a week back with my brother Shoaib Hossain who’s also an NSUer, so basically it’s still a baby. In future I’ve plans to add varieties. Would be very grateful to everyone if you help my page and group to grow. Please don’t hesitate to knock me, my brother or in the page to know any query.
